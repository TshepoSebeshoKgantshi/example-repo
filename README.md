# example-repo

This repository contains the Inventory Management Python program (`inventory.py`) and its data file (`inventory.txt`). The program loads shoe inventory records, allows adding/viewing/searching shoes, restocking the lowest-quantity item, calculating values, and generating basic outputs via a menu-driven interface.
